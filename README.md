# 🧠 Applied Artificial Intelligence (5001CMD) Coursework

## Project Summary

This repository contains the core practical components and formal academic documentation for the **Artificial Intelligence (5001CMD)** module. The projects demonstrate proficiency in key AI subfields, including:

1.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Development of a simple, stateful chatbot agent.
2.  **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Hand-coding a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network) for classification/prediction.
3.  **Academic Documentation:** Formal reporting and analysis of various AI concepts and lab exercises.

The work showcases a strong foundation in Python, algorithm implementation, and the ability to articulate complex concepts in a formal setting.

## 💻 Core Python Projects

### 1. Conversational Agent (`basic_chatbot.py`)

This project is a simple, rule-based intelligent agent designed to process user input and maintain conversational state (memory).

* **Functionality:**
    * **Intent Recognition:** Uses keyword matching to categorize user input (e.g., "what is AI", "will AI take my job").
    * **Memory Management:** Implements persistent storage (`memory.json`) to remember the user's name across sessions, enabling personalized responses.
    * **Emotion Handling:** Attempts basic emotion detection and adjusts fallback responses based on the user's inferred emotional state (e.g., "fear," "sad").
* **Demonstrated Skills:** Basic NLP, State Management, Human-Computer Interaction logic.

### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron Implementation (`basic_neural_network.py`)

This project implements a foundational neural network from scratch, without reliance on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

* **Architecture:** A basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with two inputs, two hidden units, and one output.
* **Training:** Features a custom implementation of the **Backpropagation** algorithm for weight updates.
* **Key Components Implemented:**
    * **Sigmoid Activation Function:** Used for non-linear transformation between layers.
    * **Epoch Control:** Manages the number of training iterations.
    * **Learning Rate Control:** Manages the step size for weight adjustment during training.
* **Demonstrated Skills:** Core Machine Learning mechanics, Backpropagation, Fundamental mathematical basis of neural networks.

## 📄 Formal Academic Report

The file **`report.docx`** is the final academic report for the module. It provides comprehensive written context, analysis, and supporting evidence for the practical work, including:

* **Lab Exercises:** Documentation covering experiments from Labs 1, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5, and 7.
* **Calculations & Explanations:** Formal explanations of machine learning outputs (Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Trees) and Knowledge Representation concepts (Semantic Networks, Prolog outcomes).
* **Evidence:** Includes screenshots and written analysis of both basic and advanced tasks completed throughout the course.

This report confirms proficiency in articulating technical work and providing detailed justification for algorithmic choices and experimental results.
